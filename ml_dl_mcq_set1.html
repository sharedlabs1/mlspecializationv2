                scenario: "TechCorp Real Estate wants to build an automated valuation model using 50,000 historical home sales with features like square footage, location, bedrooms, and sale prices.",

                    "A) Unsupervised learning with clustering",
                    "B) Supervised learning with regression",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Since we have historical data with known target values (sale prices), this is a supervised learning problem. We're predicting continuous values (prices), making it a regression task."

                    "A) Accuracy and Precision",

                correct: 1,

                    "A) Drop all rows with any missing values",

                scenario: "The model needs hyperparameter tuning and final performance evaluation. The data spans 10 years (2013-2023) with potential temporal patterns.",
